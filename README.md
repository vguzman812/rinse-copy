# About

Welcome to "rinse" â€“ the Car Wash Booking Web App that redefines car owners' experience by offering a seamless platform for scheduling car washing services. The project aims to address the challenge of simplifying car wash bookings, empowering users to discover skilled car washers and effortlessly schedule services to their preferences.

Through a dynamic front-end crafted with HTML, CSS, and React, and a robust back-end driven by Node.js and Express, the app aims to facilitate secure user registration, authentication, and profile management. MongoDB will serve as the repository for critical user data, bookings, and reviews. To ensure smooth and secure transactions, the integrated Stripe payment gateway will be employed.

The primary objectives of the project include:

- Enabling users to establish profiles, inputting personal details and car information.
- Allowing car washers to showcase their expertise and service regions via dedicated profiles.
- Implementing a responsive calendar-based booking system for effortless appointment scheduling.
- Incorporating geolocation services to identify nearby car washers and provide mapping directions.
- Introducing user reviews and ratings to facilitate informed decision-making.
- Delivering comprehensive email and push notifications, encompassing booking confirmations, reminders, and review requests.

"rinse" aspires to reshape the accessibility and efficiency of car washing services, delivering a heightened sense of convenience, efficacy, and satisfaction throughout the entire user journey.
